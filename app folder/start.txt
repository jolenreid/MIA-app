From this point, each member of the group will create a new branch for any feature they are adding to the project. Do this by entering either of these two options:

git checkout -b branchName – This creates the branch and checks it out
or

git checkout branchName – This checks out the branch
Be sure to always check which branch you are on using “git status” before you begin working!


-------------------------------Merge your branch----------------------------

While in your branch you will 

git add . 

git commit -m “message”
